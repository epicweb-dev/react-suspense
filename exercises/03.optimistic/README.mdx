# Optimistic UI

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-suspense/intro-to-optimistic-ui" />

The idea of "Optimistic UI" is based on the belief that most of the time the
things your users do will be successful. So if they check off a todo, we can
instantly mark it as complete in the client while the request is made to make
the change because most of the time it will be successful. This makes the UI
feel much faster.

Learn more about the concept of Optimistic UI from the end of my talk here:

## `useOptimistic`

Transitions (like those you get from `useTransition`) prevent the UI from
changing when the component is suspended. But sometimes you want to show a
different UI while the component is suspended (and even change that UI multiple
times while it's in the suspended state).

This is where `useOptimistic` comes into play. It may even be better to call it
[`useTransitionState`](https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/1788364906900959481)
instead! In any case, the idea is that `useOptimistic` is like a `useState` hook
which will actually change the UI even while it's suspended. It's often used
to implement Optimistic UI which is why it's called `useOptimistic`.

Form Actions are automatically wrapped in `startTransition` for us so if you
have a form action for which you would like to implement optimistic UI (which
requires updating state), then you need to use `useOptimistic` to get around the
suspended nature of the transition. Here's an example of how it's used with a
Form Action:

```tsx lines=2,7,14
function Todo({ todo }: { todo: TodoItem }) {
	const [isComplete, setIsComplete] = useOptimistic(todo.isComplete)

	return (
		<form
			action={async () => {
				setIsComplete(!isComplete)
				await updateTodo(todo.id, !isComplete)
			}}
		>
			<label>
				<input
					type="checkbox"
					checked={isComplete}
					className="todos-checkbox"
				/>
				{todo.text}
			</label>
		</form>
	)
}
```

The `isComplete` is based on the `todo.isComplete`, but during the transition,
we can change it to `!isComplete`. Once the transition is finished (whether it
was successful or errored out), it will fall back to the value of
`todo.isComplete`.

And the interesting thing about this is we can update optimistic state as many
times as we would like during the course of a transition, which means if you
have a multi-step action, you could update a message to let the user know what
step in the process you're running in all with the nice declarative model of
suspense and transitions.

## `useFormStatus`

Another part of giving users feedback of their form submission is showing them
the status. `useFormStatus` can be used by any components that are underneath
a `form` element.

<callout-success>
	Think of the `form` element as a context provider and the `useFormStatus` hook
	as a context consumer.
</callout-success>

So you can make a submit button that has access to the current status of its
parent form and display a pending state while the form action is in progress:

```tsx
function SubmitButton() {
	const formStatus = useFormStatus()
	return (
		<button type="submit">
			{formStatus.pending ? 'Creating...' : 'Create'}
		</button>
	)
}
```

The `formStatus` has a number of other useful properties that can be used to
help implement optimistic UI as well (like the data that's being submitted).
