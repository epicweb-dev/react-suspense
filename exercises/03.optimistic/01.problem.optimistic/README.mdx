# Optimistic UI

🧝‍♂️ I've added a form and some API updates for us to be able to create new ships
to add to the page. As usual, you can <PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink>
if you're curious what has changed and if you'd like to implement this yourself
for some extra practice, feel free to go back to the previous solution and add
the form and API updates yourself.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie! Ok, so right now, the user experience is not great with the
amount of time it takes to create a ship and then display the newly created
ship. It definitely would be nice to let the user see as much of their newly
created ship as possible while we're in the process of saving it and loading it.

What we need is a mechanism for turning the user's submission into a Ship object
which we can use to display.

🧝‍♂️ Actually, I already implemented this as well, it's called
`createOptimisticShip` and accepts a `FormData` object. So you can use that.
You'll notice the `fetchedAt` time is set to '...' because it's not technically
been fetched yet. This is common for optimistic UI where there's some data you
can't display until the server response actually comes through. But the rest of
the data we get is what we want to display.

👨‍💼 Oh awesome. Great so what you need to do is create an optimistic ship which
we can pass to the `ShipDetails` component to display that while the real data
is being retrieved.

You'll need to store this up in the `App` component and pass the
`optimisticShip` and `setOptimisticShip` props down to the `CreateForm` and
`ShipDetails` components.

Hop to it!
