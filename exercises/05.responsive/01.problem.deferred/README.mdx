# useDeferredValue

🧝‍♂️ I've made a number of changes (<PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink>)
because we want people to be able to search through a list of ships and select
the ones they're most interested in.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie! So, here's the thing, we have a search endpoint for the filter
on the left side, and Kellie applied the same pattern for handling that async
interaction as we did with the ship details, including the `useTransition` for
showing a pending UI.

But the problem is, during the transition, the input isn't responsive to user
input. It's really annoying to use as a result. We need the UI to be responsive.

So could you please remove the transition and switch to `useDeferredValue`
instead? Make sure to keep the pending UI experience, we just want the user to
be able to interrupt the pending state by typing more into the input.

🦉 Something you might try in this exercise is adding a `console.log` of the
`search` and the `deferredSearch` and see how React renders your component twice
when you type in the input (once with the old value and once with the new
value). You'll actually see quite a few render calls as you type, but this
should be instructive. If you wish, you might add a delay argument to the
`searchShips` call (`searchShips(search, 1000)`) to simulate a slow network
response to more easily see which sets of logs are associated with which
renders.
