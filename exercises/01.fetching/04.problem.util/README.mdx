# Utility

👨‍💼 With what you've built so far, we want you to make a reusable utility for
this use case. We want you to call it `use` and it should take a promise and
return the `Value` from the promise.

The only way we can do this is by tracking some values which we'll monkey-patch
onto the `promise` itself. So Kellie's added a special type for you to use to
make TypeScript happier with the hackery we plan to perform for this simplified
version of `use`.

🧝‍♂️ Here's a good start for you:

```tsx
type UsePromise<Value> = Promise<Value> & {
	status: string
	value: Value
	reason: any
}

function use<Value>(promise: Promise<Value>): Value {
	const usePromise = promise as UsePromise<Value>
	// throw stuff, .then stuff, and return Value!
}
```

That should get you a good start. When you're done, you should be able to remove
a bunch of our code and replace it with a `use` call. Good luck!
