# Pending Flash

👨‍💼 When the user's on a reasonably fast connection, getting the ship data
doesn't take very long and as a result the loading state doesn't show up for all
that long. This is great, except it results in a flash of the loading state
while the ship takes ~50ms to load. It's jarring for the user and it would be
better if we could avoid it.

We thought about adding a CSS delay of 300ms on the opacity transition, but that
would just mean the flash of loading state happens for people for whom the data
loading takes 350ms or so. Just moving the problem 🤷‍♂️

What we really need is something that can give us the following experience:

- If the loading takes less than 300ms, don't show a loading spinner at all.
- If the loading takes longer than 300ms, show a loading spinner for at least
  350ms. Even if the loading is shorter than 300ms + 350ms.

This way, if the user has a reasonably fast connection, they won't see a loading
state at all, and if they have a medium fast connection, they'll be guaranteed
to not get a flash of loading state because the loading state will show up for
at least 350ms.

Luckily, there's a simple package that does exactly this:
[`spin-delay`](https://npm.im/spin-delay). Here's an example:

```tsx lines=1,8
import { useSpinDelay } from 'spin-delay'

function MyComponent() {
	const data = use(somePromise)
	const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()

	// options are optional, and default to these values
	const showSpinner = useSpinDelay(isPending, { delay: 500, minDuration: 200 })

	if (showSpinner) {
		return <Spinner />
	}

	// ...
}
```

So let's add this with a `delay` of `300` and a `minDuration` of `350` to the
`Ship` component.

To test this experience out, you can update the `getShip` call with a second
argument which is a `delay` that will ensure the request takes at least that
amount of time (it's not super precise, but it should give you an idea).
