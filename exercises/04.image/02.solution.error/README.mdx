👨‍💼 Great! Hopefully our users don't encouter this much, but at least when they
do we'll provide as useful information as possible.

Additionally, we could definitely come up with a better fallback. I don't want
you walking away from this thinking that rendering a broken image is the best
approach to this. But it's a start!
